Ideas for improvements that require brainstorming:

    Get rid of recursion in conditional comments
    Better choice of output stream (System.out vs System.error) for command line compressor to separate compression results from error reports and help screens
    Better exception handling in java api. Should compression throw any exceptions or catch them?
    Look into error logging (java.util.logging, log4j, slf4j bridge?)
    Look into possibility of creating complex js/css/html compression solution that produces googleplus-like compression results [shrinking css classes](https://github.com/hazendaz/htmlcompressor/issues/46)

If you have any suggestions about features listed (or not listed) above please create an [Issue report](https://github.com/hazendaz/htmlcompressor/issues).
